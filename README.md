# MSNAEducation
Analysis tools to calculate and measure the education indicators starting from the MSNA data. 

## To start
To start, download/clone/fork the repository 

 ``` 
https://github.com/martivit/MSNAEducation.git
 ```

and add daset, kobo, and dap in the following directories:<br />
> /input/dataset/ <br />
> /input/kobo/  <br />
> /input/dap/ <br />

#### IMPORTANT: Context Specific Addition
The most ***important*** part is to fill and save the excel file in: <br />

> /contextspecific/context_info.xlsx <br />

In this file you are asked to provide the school-age cycle info, the name of the variables, demographic labeling etc etc that are changing from context to context. 
Without these info the scripts won't work.
